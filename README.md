https://github.com/UVA-CS3240-S18/Lab2Fork-102/pull/31 - link to pull request.
I removed the commented out variable from the closest_wendys.py because they did not serve any purpose other
than not being used and does not really help understanding the code.

Activity 4: 
https://github.com/UVA-CS3240-S18/IveGotIssues/issues/126 - issue.

Activity 5:
added the .gitignore to the hello-world repo from Activity 1.
